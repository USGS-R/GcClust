\description{
In 2006, soil samples were collected at 960 sites (1 site per 280 square
kilometers) throughout the state of Colorado. These samples were collected
from a depth of 0-15 centimeters and, following a near-total multi-acid
digestion, were analyzed for a suite of 44 major and trace
elements.

\details{
The data are from Smith and others (2010); selected summary statistics of
these data are presented in Ellefsen and others (2014).

These data have been edited to make them suitable for
analysis. First, field sample "06co437" has been deleted because
it has an anomalously high copper concentration.
Second, elements silver (Ag), cesium (Cs), mercury (Hg),
tellurium (Te), and selenium (Se) have been deleted because 98\%, 77\%,
69\%, 94\%, and 45\%, respectively, of the measured concentrations are below
the lower limit of determination. (The lower limit of determination is
the threshold for left-censoring.) The lower limits of determination are
listed in Table 1 of Smith et al., 2010.

Third, elements antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), bismuth (Bi), cadmium (Cd),
indium (In), phosphorous (P), and sulfur (S) have 0.208\%, 0.417\%, 1.15\%,
5.62\%, 14.1\%, 0.521\%, and 3.02\%, respectively, of the measured
concentrations below the lower limit of determination.
These left-censored concentrations were assigned concentrations equal to
0.65 times their respective lower limit of determination
(Palarea-Albaladejo and others, 2014).
Finally, element concentrations were
scaled, as necessary, so that the units for all concentrations are "mg/kg"
or equivalently "ppm".

After this editing, there are 959 field samples for which
39 element concentrations are reported.
The locations of the field samples are specified by lattitude and longitude
using the WGS84 datum.
